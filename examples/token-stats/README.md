# Compound Token Stats (APR Proof)

**An example that calls multiple view functions on the Compound USDC contract to compute the APR.**

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need to have Rust installed. If you haven't done so, follow the instructions [here][install-rust].

Next, install the `cargo risczero` tool. We'll use `cargo binstall` to facilitate this. Detailed instructions can be found at [cargo-binstall].

```bash
cargo install cargo-binstall
cargo binstall cargo-risczero
```

Finally, install the `risc0` toolchain with the following command:

```bash
cargo risczero install
```

You'll also need access to an Ethereum RPC node, such as through [Alchemy](www.alchemy.com).

## Run the example

To run the example, which computes the current APR of the Compound USDC Token `0xc3d688B66703497DAA19211EEdff47f25384cdc3` on Ethereum, execute the following command:

```bash
RPC_URL=https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release
```

The output should resemble the following:

```text
