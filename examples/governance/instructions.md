# Running this example locally

Before starting, make sure to follow the [Installation guide][install-risc0] to have both Rust and RISC Zero's toolchain installed. You'll also need [Foundry][install-foundry] to be installed.

## Setup

From the root of the example repo, run:

```sh
cargo build
forge install
forge build
```

## Running tests

> [!TIP]
> You can adjust the number of fuzz runs for each test case, by changing the `runs` variable in [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml). Higher values gives more confidence in results at the cost of testing speed, see more info at [Fuzz - Foundry Docs][foundry-fuzz-docs].

```sh
RISC0_DEV_MODE=true forge test -vvv
```

Once completed, you should see some output similar to below.

```sh
RISC0_DEV_MODE=true forge test -vvv

## Generating data and gas plots

In the `tests/benchmarks` folder, there are two Python files. They both handle data written to a csv from the [BenchmarkGovernorsTest.sol](./tests/benchmarks/BenchmarkGovernorsTest.sol) file using Foundry's writing data cheatcode.

- [print_gas_data.py]: pretty prints data from `gas_data.csv`
- [plot_gas_data.py]: generates a matplotlib plot of gas usage in .png format: [gas_data_comparison.png]

To set up your python environment, it is recommend to use a virtual environment such as `venv` or `conda`.

### Using venv

Change into the benchmarks directory with:

```sh
cd tests/benchmarks
```

Create the virtual environment with:

```sh
python -m venv governance
```

Activate the virtual environment with:

```sh
source governance/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements with:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Using conda

Change into the benchmarks directory with:

```sh
cd tests/benchmarks
```

Create the virtual environment with:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the virtual environment with:

```sh
conda activate governance
```

## Running the print/plot python files

Change into the benchmarks directory with:

```sh
cd tests/benchmarks
```

Make sure the correct environment is activated and all the dependencies installed either with [venv](#using-venv) or an alternative like [conda](#using-conda).

The data is only generated when the tests are run, see [running tests].

```sh
python print_gas_data.py
```

```sh
python plot_gas_data.py
```

The plot generated will be saved as [gas_data_comparison.png]:
