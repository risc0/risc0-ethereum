# RISC Zero Ethereum

[RISC Zero] is a zero-knowledge verifiable general computing platform, with [Ethereum] integration.
This repository contains [Solidity verifier contracts][contracts], [Relay], [View Call] library, and supporting libraries.

If you are looking to get started using RISC Zero in the application on Ethereum, the best place to look is the [Foundry template][template].

You can also find the documentation for RISC Zero, including guides for [writing zkVM programs][risc0-quickstart], [using the Bonsai prover][bonsai-quickstart], and more at [dev.risczero.com].

## Contracts

RISC Zero's Ethereum contracts, including the on-chain verifier, can be found in the [contracts] directory.

## Relay

The Relay is a service that can be run to accept proving requests from on-chain events or via REST Request, and post receipts to the developer's application contract as a callback.
It represents one way of accepting requests, and posting proofs to Ethereum.
It is also possible to write your application without using the Relay.

You can find and overview of how the Relay works, [in our documentation][relay-overview].
Source code for the Relay is in the [relay] directory.

## View Call
A library to query Ethereum state, or any other EVM-based blockchain state. It leverages the [alloy] library to make its use Solidity-friendly.
